          Welcome to <strong>Sakshi Hi-tech Nursery</strong>, a place where nature meets care and quality.
          Our journey began on <strong>April 4, 2020</strong>, with a dream to bring the beauty of plants.
          Founded by <strong>Prop. Vijay Trambakrao Khaire</strong>, our nursery started as a small effort to provide
          healthy, beautiful plants to local plant lovers.
          <br /><br />
          In the beginning, like any new venture, we faced many challenges. It wasnâ€™t easy to attract customers or
          meet their expectations. We had to constantly find ways to improve the quality of our plants and build trust
          with our early customers. But we never gave up. With hard work, passion, and belief in our vision, we kept going.
          <br /><br />
          Over time, we adopted the latest technologies and followed proper plant management techniques to ensure the best
          care for every plant we grow. We focused on improving our processes, soil quality, watering systems, and overall
          plant health. These changes helped us serve our customers better and provide them with long-lasting plants.
          <br /><br />
          Slowly but surely, more customers started to notice our work. They appreciated the high-quality plants and the
          dedication behind them. As our customer base grew, so did our reach. What started as a small nursery soon expanded,
          and our plants began reaching customers in other states as well. We built strong connections with customers from
          different places and continued to grow with their support.
          <br /><br />
          Today, <strong>Sakshi Hi-tech Nursery</strong> is known for its top-quality plants and excellent customer service.
          We also guide our customers on how to care for their plants, offering tips, support, and personalized advice.
          Whether you're a beginner or a farmer, we're here to help you.
